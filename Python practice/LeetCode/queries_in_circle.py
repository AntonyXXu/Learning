# You are given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] is the coordinates of the ith point on a 2D plane. 
# Multiple points can have the same coordinates.

# You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj] describes a circle centered at (xj, yj) with a radius of rj.

# For each query queries[j], compute the number of points inside the jth circle. Points on the border of the circle are considered inside.

# Return an array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.
